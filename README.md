This repository contains the following:
1) arjbin: (Mostly) Shell scripts that I use as commands
2) arjcode: Code that I use for analysis, visualization, starting points for experiments, etc.
3) arjnotes: Any notes, diagrams, and resources that I want to store for future reference
4) arjscripts: Any non-bin scripts or apps that I use often

This repo is mainly for personal use and is updated infrequently an irregularly (i.e. only when I have new stuff to add to it).
